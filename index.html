                        <h2>BLOC Web Developer Track Student</h2>
                 <p>Hello, my name is Mirella C. Gonzalez and I am currently learning Web Development at BLOC and living in the San Francisco bay area. </p>
                 <p>In my prior work experience as a Payroll Manager and while attending San Francisco State University, working with others as necessary was vital to accomplish group projects and tasks. It allowed me to listen to other ideas and thoughts as well as give my ideas and inputs.  I believe sharing ideas, teamwork, and collaboration with others provides a deeper, better experience with coding and mostly anything else in life, for that matter. My willingness to work with others allows me to brainstorm, collaborate, and interact with different people.</p>

                        <p class="about-me"> 
                            I’m passionate about Web Development because it allows me to solve problems and be creative at the same time.  I like the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem by looking for creative solutions, which challenges me to think outside the box.  I enjoy creating something from scratch or finding solutions to improve something challenging but very rewarding. I can finally put my creative side to work. I’m currently a student at Thinkful/BLOC and I find fulfillment in going from a blank text editor to a fully working site.</p>
                           <p class="about-me">In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.  I love trying new foods, listening to music, movies, and traveling as much as possible.</p>
